              <h3>INREM foundation is an NGO working in the water quality sector in India. Due to a recent EU grant, their work has been scaling across a larger part of the country. To aid this, they
                identified the need for a ‘knowledge platform’ and it was in this context that we came in— to help better define the ‘platform’, and then to build it.</h3>
              <p>INREM’s primary focus is on the mitigation of fluorosis— a disease that is rampant in certain rural pockets of the country. With the EU project, their efforts have spread to 8 districts
                in the country, with a 3 year roadmap from 2019 - 2021. One of the agendas of this plan, was to find ways to enable the transfer of ideas, knowledge and learnings, amongst the various actors
                in this sector. This, they felt, could catalyse efforts towards the vision of a 'fluorosis free India’.</p>

                Our first meeting with the folks at INREM, and the many other actors in the water quality sector, was at the Fluoride Knowledge & Action Network’s ‘technology meet’. Here, conversations ranged from chatbots to ‘local internets’ to a national
                community platform, to of course, learning management solutions & knowledge platforms.</p>
              <p>What we learned here was that, this sector largely lacks government support. INREM was trying to work around this, by bringing together an otherwise fragmented network of organisations, practitioners & front line workers. We were beginning
                to see how the knowledge platform would fit into their larger vision for the network.</p>

              <p><strong>Project Kick off: Understanding the vague idea of a 'knowledge platform'</strong><br>
                How has the water quality sector been sharing knowledge in the many years before the conception of a ‘knowledge platform’? What gaps exists in their system (if any) that the platform could address? We probed some of these questions at the kick off workshop with the INREM team.</p>
                <p>After mapping out the various actors and their relationships in this sector, we went through a prioritisation exercise, and narrowed our focus down to 4 ‘actor/entity archetypes’— </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>NGO Strategy and Planning People,</li>
                  <li>NGO Resource People,</li>
                  <li>District Collector's Office,</li>
                  <li>Other NGOs (health, nutrition, sanitation etc)</li>
                </ul>
              <p>For each of these archetypes, we collaboratively defined their knowledge needs (what do they need to know, to do their work more effectively), and their knowledge superpowers (what do they know, that could help others do their work more effectively).
                This formed the basis atop which, the platform idea started to take form.</p>

              <p><strong>The Actual Build - Platform version 0.1</strong><br>
                The National Water Quality Network Meet was scheduled to take place by the end of February.
                Keeping this as our first milestone, we worked with the INREM team to prioritise certain content types & user flows.</p>
              <p>There was a collective agreement that spreading the 'stories from the ground' was the need of the hour. Besides, this content type strongly embodied the philosophical standing of the platform as well. So, the design & development processes that followed, primarily focussed on enabling people to contribute compelling stories.</p>
              <p>When we started building out the platform we decided, to not get too caught up in building the perfect interface, but rather, to follow the analogy— first build a skateboard, then a bicycle, and only then, the car. As a 2 person ‘product team’ having experience working with each other, we
                would at times, jump directly from wireframes to code, and on other occasions, sketch out high fidelity screen designs when trying to comprehend & explore more complex use cases— discoverability of content, for example.</p>

                By January end, we tested platform 0.1, with some of INREM’s team members— from strategy & planning people, to NGO resource people. We wanted to specifically test the 'storytelling templates' that we'd created.
                So, the team was given a simple task— to contribute on the platform, a recent, impactful story that they experienced in the field.
                A story, that they felt, fellow practitioners needed to hear.</p>
              <p>High energy & enthusiasm sustained through the workshop, which was great, and a few very clear insights emerged by the end of it. One of them being, our ‘storytelling template’
                was viewed as a helpful assistant, but prescriptive at times. It became clear that the idea of storytelling templates was compelling, but there were clearly some flaws in its implementation.</p>

                Over 3 days, this meet saw various actors from the sector— from funders, to frontline workers— convene together for workshops, discussions & knowledge sharing.
                A big part of this, was a ‘storytelling workshop’ conducted by Ever After— specialists in the field. Of the many useful storytelling tools that were introduced to us,
                one big learning was about the 4 essential building blocks of a story— context, characters, events & outcomes. This gave us a solid framework, to revisit & iterate on the platform’s storytelling template.</p>
              <p>The national meet warmed up the various district teams of the EU project, to an ‘upcoming knowledge platform’.
                Soon after the meet we held a series of webinars with them, onboarding & activating them to start contributing on the platform.</p>

                Drawing from tests, feedback and the storytelling workshop, we are currently building out a v 0.2 of the platform. Broken into 4 sprints, we have kicked off with the most crucial flow— contributing content.
                The focus content type continues to be 'stories from the ground', though, we plan to bring in 'data stories' and 'how-tos' very soon.</p>
              <p>How can we create a guided template that is flexible enough to accommodate for the non-linear nature of stories? How can we ‘hint’ uses to elaborate on certain key elements of a story, such as—
                context, characters, events, outcomes etc— rather than enforcing a linear order of these elements? Starting from questions such as these, we are dwelling into the finer details that make or break a user’s experience.
                And from there, we are designing & building platform 0.2. This sprint is underway at the time of writing this piece. Further updates shall follow soon.</p>

              <p><strong>Participatory Design</strong><br>
                We co-designed the platform with many of the folks who are currently using it. And we plan to continue doing so.</p>

              <p><strong>Lean product development widened my perspective on product design.</strong><br>
                  Lean design & development has it’s advantages with regards to reducing rollout time, testing early, course correcting early,
                  etc etc. But a big learning for me was the UX tweaks and choices that had to be made in the process, to address technical implementation
                  related issues. These issues rarely come to mind when designers aren’t intimately involved with the development of the product, and this experience reconfirmed my belief in integrated design-development teams.</p>

              <h3 class="section-title">Challenges Faced</h3>
              <p>Limited funds for this project meant that we couldn’t put together a dedicated full-time team for it. Building a product in a lean & iterative manners requires constant back & forth within the team, as well as with other stakeholders.
                But because of a limited & fragmented team, the process was relatively slower than what could have been.</p>
              <p>Another side effect of limited team members was that, I had to take on responsibility for developing the product, which is not my primary skill. As enjoyable as the learning journey was, it also contributed to slowing down the process, not
                to mention the multitasking challenges that I had to face, trying to balance product management, UX design & development.</p>

              <p>Since the webinars with the district teams, stories are trickling onto the platform, along with feedback ofcourse— qualitative & quantitative. These have already started to shed light on what flows & use-cases need to be prioritised and improved upon.</p>

              <p>Besides that, version 0.2 sprints are also underway. These sprints primarily focus on a major upgrade to the contribute and edit workflow. These flows also happen to be the ones that have received some critical feedback post
                the webinars, so focussing on improving them makes all the more sense.</p>
              <p>The longer roadmap looks to introduce other content types, like data, <span class="italic">how tos</span> & even a ‘composite article’— for example— a <span class="italic">how to</span> set up a rainwater harvester + a <span class="italic">story</span> about it’s implementation + some <span class="italic">data</span> analysing
                its impact on the community— all of it combined into a single powerful composite article. Discoverability of content is also on the horizon, for which we are beginning to think about classification, tagging etc, but we do not plan
                to get too deeply into it, not until we have a larger user-base & content bank.</p>
